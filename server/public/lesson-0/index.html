Welcome to the **Universality** workshop! Today, we'll try to learn a bit about building a &ldquo;[universal]<sup>.red[1]</sup>&rdquo; web application leveraging tools such as [kraken] and [react].

This workshop will be a combination of presentations (like this) and command-line exercises.

You can provide instanteous emotional feedback with the Emotibar&#8482;<sup>.red[2]</sup> you see towards the top right of your screen.

We will be going over a number of concepts and tools that make building a universal application a snap. Gone are the days of maintaining two separate codebases or having to prerender in another runtime and stitch logic together.

You're expected to be familiar with javascript as well as node and kraken. Beyond that, there is a lot of material to cover but don't be discouraged if something isn't immediately clear.

This workshop is intended to serve as an introduction on where to look&mdash;really _getting it_ will require further learning on your own.
