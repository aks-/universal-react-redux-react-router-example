## Lesson 3:
### Server-Side Rendering with React

### Background
Given all the things we've learned about React so far&mdash;in particular, how it performs its DOM mutations after first performing updates on another tree structure (virtual DOM)â€”it should come as no surprise that rendering React components server-side is equally straight forward.

While that's one extremely helpful chunk of work lifted off our plates, there still remains a few big, unanswered questions:

1. How do I get my components and data packaged up and in a way that they can be rehydrated on the client?
2. How do I deal with routing?

First, lets see how React helps us.

## Rendering React Components
### &hellip; server-side

### Server-side rendering React components

This will be the easiest part of this entire workshop.

As you'll recall, the method signature for rendering React client-side is:
``` js
React.render(component, domNode);
```

To render on the server, it's as simple as:
``` js
React.renderToString(component);
```

That takes care of the rendering piece but ignores dehydrating / rehydrating the data that goes into that component. Which leads us to our next topic &hellip;
???
This method will be pulled into a separate module when React is split into React/ReactDOM

## Sharing Data
### Between server and client

### Sharing Data
How do I get my state objects from the server to the client?

There are a number of ways but the easiest is simply to dehydrate your store (meaning, get a representation of it that is parseable from clientside JS), and stuff it on the client on initial load. It may not be pretty but this gets the job done:
``` js
<script>window.__INITIAL_DATA__=object;</script>
```
This is an area where using something like [redux] really shines. With a single store object, the amount of work reconciling your state on the client goes from a big challenge to nearly automatic.

``` js
const store = createStore();
// dispatch actions on the store to seed it ...
const finalState = store.getState();
const inclusion = `<script>window.__initial = ${finalState}</script>`;

res.render(page, {snippet: inclusion});
```

Just one quick example. You could also have a special `createStore` you serve on initial requests, or XHR it in, etc.

## React-Router

## React-Router
One of the larger moving parts in our workshop, [react-router] is an extremely helpful module for writing a well organized app (not to mention, a universal one). It means largely eschewing the router that ships with expressjs, but that generally isn't a problem.

React-router enables you to define a set of nested routes. When a route matches, the component tree that makes up that route is composed in your app. It takes care of handling many things for you, including `pushState` monitoring (if using `BrowserHistory`), etc.

It also enables you to fetch portions of your application on-demand. That goes beyond the scope of this workshop but see the documentation for [getComponents](http://rackt.github.io/react-router/tags/v1.0.0-beta3.html#-getcomponents-state-cb-) and [getChildRoutes](http://rackt.github.io/react-router/tags/v1.0.0-beta3.html#-getchildroutes-state-callback-) for more info.

## Warning: v1.0.0-beta4
### The examples are using a beta API&mdash;
### they are likely to change

### React-Router (Continued)
The simplest implementation of React-Router will look something like this:
``` js
import { Router, Route } from 'react-router';
import { createHistory } from 'history';
import { Admin } from './components';
import React from 'react';
const history = createHistory();

class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>welcome to my app</h1>
        {this.props.children}
      </div>
    );
  }
}

React.render((
  <Router history={history}>
    <Route path='/' component={App}>
      <Route path='admin' component={Components.Admin}/>
    </Route>
  </Router>
), document.body);
```

???

In this case, '/' will resolve and print the h1, while '/admin' will also resolve, printing the h1 and whatever is in `Components.Admin`.

### React-Router (Continued)

The surface for react-router is fairly large, and the API is changing fairly rapidly, however a few on the notable features include:

1. A `<Link>` component that automatically sets up navigation for you (with active state tracking)
2. Component grouping, so that a route can define some components in multiple parts of a layout
3. Absolute paths in route paths to maintain a similar layout, yet full control over the route
4. `*` and `IndexRoute` for catch-all and un-nested routes
5. Navigation API, transition callbacks, etc &hellip;
---
### React-Router - Server-side render
This is currently in flux however, the API will look _something_ like the following:
``` js
let history = useRoutes(createHistory)({ routes });
let location = createLocation('/');

history.match(location, function (error, state) {
  let string = React.renderToString(
    <RoutingContext history={history} {...state} />
  );
});
```

For now, there are a few workarounds necessary (or you can always use the previous version but note that it has a vastly different API).
